# Gradient Descent Visualizer

This project provides an interactive visualization of the gradient descent optimization algorithm. Users can experiment with different functions, learning rates, and initial points to see how gradient descent behaves under various conditions.

## Features

- Interactive selection of optimization parameters
- Visualization of optimization path on contour plots
- Support for multiple test functions (currently Quadratic and Rosenbrock)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradient-descent-visualizer.git
   cd gradient-descent-visualizer
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

Then open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
